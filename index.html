<p style="background-color: white;">
A movie theater or cinema hall, is a building that contains auditorium for viewing films for entertainment. Most, but not all, theaters are commercial operations catering to the general public, who attend by purchasing a ticket. This online website of mine will ease the way of <strong> booking a ticket for a flim instead of standing in long lines outside a cinema booking tickets.</strong> Here also i will offer a lots of movies in the market that can be booked and also aloow them to selct their seats. customers can also book popcorn and stuff with the ticket price plus the food price and just give the cupon at the counter to get their food. this will save time for many and can be <b> done at your home.
